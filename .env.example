# Directory containing PDF documents
# Should have an 'unprocessed' subdirectory for incoming files

# Config directory containing:
#   - rclone.conf (cloud storage authentication)
#   - post-scan-commands/ (optional directory with executable scripts)
CONFIG_DIR=/path/to/your/config

# Rclone remote and destination path
# Format: RemoteName:path/to/destination
# The RemoteName must match a remote configured in rclone.conf
# Examples:
#   Dropbox:Cabinet/Documents
#   GoogleDrive:Documents/PDFs
#   S3:my-bucket/documents
#   OneDrive:Documents
RCLONE_REMOTE=Dropbox:Cabinet/Documents

# Check interval in minutes - how often to scan for new PDFs
# Script has built-in locking to prevent concurrent runs
INTERVAL_MINUTES=1

# Maximum number of PDFs to process in parallel
# Higher values = faster processing but more CPU/memory usage
# Default is 1 (sequential). Increase for faster processing on powerful systems.
# Recommended: 3-4 for desktop/server, 5-8 for powerful servers
MAX_PARALLEL_JOBS=1

# File age threshold in minutes - only process files older than this
# Prevents processing files that are still being written
MINUTES_OLD=2

# Timezone for timestamps
