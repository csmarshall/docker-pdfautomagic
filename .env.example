# Directory containing PDF documents
# Should have an 'unprocessed' subdirectory for incoming files
SCAN_DIR=/path/to/your/pdfs

# Config directory containing:
#   - rclone.conf (cloud storage authentication)
#   - post-scan-commands/ (optional directory with executable scripts)
CONFIG_DIR=/path/to/your/config

# Timezone for container and timestamps
# Sets the TZ environment variable inside the container
# Affects log timestamps, file naming timestamps, and post-scan hook variables
# Format: Area/Location (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)
# Examples: America/Chicago, America/New_York, Europe/London, Asia/Tokyo
TIMEZONE=America/Chicago

# Rclone remote and destination path
# Format: RemoteName:path/to/destination
# The RemoteName must match a remote configured in rclone.conf
# Examples:
#   Dropbox:Cabinet/Documents
#   GoogleDrive:Documents/PDFs
#   S3:my-bucket/documents
#   OneDrive:Documents
RCLONE_REMOTE=Dropbox:Cabinet/Documents

# User and Group ID for file ownership
# Set these to match the owner of your scan directory
# Use 'id username' to find UID/GID, or 'ls -n /path/to/scan/dir' to see numeric IDs
# Default: 1000:1000 (typical first user on Linux)
# Example for SMB/CIFS shares: Use the UID:GID of the user that owns the share
PUID=1000
PGID=1000

# Check interval in minutes - how often to scan for new PDFs
# Script has built-in locking to prevent concurrent runs
INTERVAL_MINUTES=1

# Maximum number of PDFs to process in parallel
# Higher values = faster processing but more CPU/memory usage
# Default is 1 (sequential). Increase for faster processing on powerful systems.
# Recommended: 3-4 for desktop/server, 5-8 for powerful servers
MAX_PARALLEL_JOBS=1

# File age threshold in minutes - only process files older than this
# Prevents processing files that are still being written
MINUTES_OLD=2
